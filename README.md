# Portfolio
This is my new portfolio website. 

Users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
Add items to the cart
View the cart and remove items from it
Frontend is done in React.js, for styling I used Sass.
